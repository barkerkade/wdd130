    <h2>Kade Barker</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, I am 24 years old and I am from Idaho. I was born and raised in Twin Falls. I served a mission in Guatemala City. Yes, I am fluent in Spanish</p>
    <p>I am studying to be a computer engineer. I am married and we have an 18 month old daughter. We are hardly keeping up with her. I currently work full time as a CNC Machine operator. I love my job and I hope to be able to do more there with a degree.</p>
    <p>I am always down to play some video games. If anyone needs a friend to play, I am here. I will also try to help with homework.</p>
